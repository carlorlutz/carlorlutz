  abstract="{This textbook is a comprehensive and yet accessible introduction to non-Euclidean Laguerre geometry,
    for which there exists no previous systematic presentation in the literature. Moreover, we present new results
    by demonstrating all essential features of Laguerre geometry on the example of checkerboard incircular nets.
    Classical (Euclidean) Laguerre geometry studies oriented hyperplanes, oriented hyperspheres, and their oriented
    contact in Euclidean space. We describe how this can be generalized to arbitrary Cayley-Klein spaces,
    in particular hyperbolic and elliptic space, and study the corresponding groups of Laguerre transformations.
    We give an introduction to Lie geometry and describe how these Laguerre geometries can be obtained as subgeometries.
    As an application of two-dimensional Lie and Laguerre geometry we study the properties of checkerboard incircular nets.

  abstract="{A decoration of a hyperbolic surface of finite type is a choice of circle, horocycle or hypercycle about
    each cone-point, cusp or flare of the surface, respectively. In this article we show that a decoration induces a unique
    canonical tessellation and dual decomposition of the underlying surface. They are analogues of the weighted Delaunay
    tessellation and Voronoi decomposition in the Euclidean plane. We develop a characterisation in terms of the hyperbolic
    geometric equivalents of DELAUNAY's empty-discs and LAGUERRE's tangent-distance, also known as power-distance. Furthermore,
    the relation between the tessellations and convex hulls in Minkowski space is presented, generalising the Epstein-Penner convex
    hull construction. This relation allows us to extend WEEKS' flip algorithm to the case of decorated finite type hyperbolic
    surfaces. Finally, we give a simple description of the configuration space of decorations and show that any fixed hyperbolic
    surface only admits a finite number of combinatorially different canonical tessellations.

  abstract = {This cumulative dissertation introduces and develops the new theory of decorated discrete conformal equivalence. A decoration of a
    piecewise hyperbolic, Euclidean, or spherical surface is a choice of circle about each of its conical singularities. Our decorated surfaces are
    intimately related to inversive distance circle packings, canonical tessellations of hyperbolic surfaces, and convex hyperbolic polyhedra. We prove
    the discrete uniformization theorems for decorated surfaces.
    <br>
    In the special case that all vertex circles degenerate to points, this recovers the known
    uniformization theorems for discrete conformal maps. Furthermore, we show that one can deform continuously between decorated piecewise hyperbolic, Euclidean,
    and spherical surfaces sharing the same fundamental discrete conformal invariant. Therefore, there is but one master theory of discrete conformal equivalence in
    different background geometries.
    <br>
    Our approach is based on concave variational principles, which provide a way to compute the discrete uniformization and
    geometric transitions. They are given by the Legendre transformations of the volumes of convex hyperbolic polyhedra. Therefore, our discussion also provides
    an explicit variational method to compute the realization of hyperbolic surfaces with ends as the boundary of convex parabolic or Fuchsian polyhedra.
    <br>
    A key aspect of the theory is to understand the combinatorial change that can accrue while continuously deforming a decorated discrete metric. We show that the
    combinatorics of decorated piecewise hyperbolic, Euclidean, and spherical surfaces correspond to the canonical tessellations of decorated hyperbolic surfaces
    with ends. Their decorated Teichm√ºller spaces are the configuration spaces of our variational principles. We analyze the decompositions of these spaces, which
    are induced by canonical tessellations. In particular, we generalize the Epstein-Penner convex hull construction, Weeks' flip algorithm, and Akiyoshi's
    compactification theorem to the case of hyperbolic surfaces with ends of infinite area.
