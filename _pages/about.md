I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [institute of mathematics](https://www.tu.berlin/en/math) of the [Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin (TU Berlin)](https://tu.berlin/en).

Prior to the current position I was an investigator in the [A01 project](https://www.discretization.de/projects/A01/) of the in the collaborative reserch center [SFB/TRR 109 "Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics"](http://discretization.de) and a member of the [Berlin Mathematical School (BMS)](https://www.math-berlin.de/). I received my doctoral degree (2024) in mathematics at [TU Berlin](https://tu.berlin/en) advised by [Alexander Bobenko](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~bobenko/).

My research is in <span class="aboutem">discrete differential geometry (DDG)</span>, which aims to identify structure-preserving discretizations of the smooth theory. In particular, I am engaged in the study of <span class="aboutem">discrete conformal equivalence</span> theories, <span class="aboutem">circle packings/patterns</span> and their relationship to the geometry of <span class="aboutem">polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space</span>. Recently, I have taken up interest in the connections of circle patterns to <span class="aboutem">complex projective structures</span> and <span class="aboutem">statistical mechanics<span>.
